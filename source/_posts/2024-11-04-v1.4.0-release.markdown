The SDAP community is pleased to announce our latest release of Apache SDAP, version 1.4.0. This release includes introductory
support for 3-dimensional data, with a reference implementation for visualizing TomoSAR (3-dimensional synthetic aperture radar
tomography). Other 3D use cases could include oceanographic modelling at different depths or atmospheric measurements at different
elevations/pressures.
